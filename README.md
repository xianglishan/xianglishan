- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xianglishan
- ğŸ‘” I'm just started my career as a data analyst, and I'm just beginning to learn data science.
- ğŸ‘€ I'm not an engineer by any means, but I'm interested in the technical field and would like to learn Azure and aws (just for fun).
- ğŸŒ± I'm going to use this github as a place to store various source codes and scrap what I've done and what I'm interested in at the following site (Zenn).
